* ex0 failed attempt of checking columns
* ex1 working attempt with HashSet, breakthrough example
* ex2 this is part I of simulating sort_by in engine-q

* ex3 moving on to lots more cases

##### The big breakthrough with ex4 and ex5 was returning an Option instead of a Result

* ex5 so I got ex5 working first and then migrated the code logic to ex4

* ex4 add in the wildcard to catch the Option None to simulate case not covered
* ex4 the match arm returns an Option instead of the Ordering
