This is the reading redis side of
[maman](https://github.com/spk/maman)

For the write side of maman simply run maman out of the box.

#### examples/ex03.rs

We are now able to drill down and get at the data that
is stored in redis via the maman spider...

### Notes

To do a test run follow these steps:

```
Run the hyper example to create a simple hello world website
cre hello

In the maman repo crawl the local hello world website
cr http://localhost:3000

Then in rust-examples/maman
cre ex01
```
